\chapter{Inter Island Trade Organisation (IITO)}

The role of IITO is to organise communication between islands to facilitate inter-island agreements and the giving and receiving of gifts.  

\section{Inter-Island Agreements}  
\label{sec:IITO:inter_island_agreements}  

% Inter-island agreements:
%     - Foraging group formation
%     - Group foraging location
%     - Intended common pool donation
%     - Want to provide islands with enough freedom of communication to allow for interesting simulation
%     - Limited by complexity of agent - too much freedom == not enough time for implementation / overly complex strategies 

Islands being able to reach agreements independently from the main governing body allows for more complex strategies. With the implemented system, islands are able to form a group for collective foraging with other, decide where said group will forage, and inform other islands of the amount they intend to to donate to the common pool.  

\section{Gifting}  
\label{sec:IITO:gifting}  

% Gifting:
%     - Struggling islands are able to request gifts from other islands without breaching rules and taking too much from common pool
%     - Allows islands to build faith among each other 
%     - Overall island survival may be in best interest of individual islands
