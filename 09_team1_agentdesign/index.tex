\chapter{Team 1 Agent Design}

\section{Opinions on Islands}
For an agent to become self-organising, it must decide what to do given certain conditions without external input. For this to be possible, the agent must have a personality, and it must hold an opinion about other islands. This will form a basis for the agent to decide on an action.

Initially, opinions about other teams are neutral. Overtime through IITO and IIGO, opinions on islands will change and different outcome will be achieved depending on the opinion value. Positive values correspond to positive opinions while negative values correspond to negative opinions.

An agent's personality can change depending on it's current resources. Below is an example of how an agent's personality can be formed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If current resources > 10 * living cost, the agent is happy
    \item If 3 * living cost < current resources < 10 * living cost, the agent is anxious
    \item If the current resources < 3 * living cost, the agent is desperate 
\end{itemize}
The upper and lower bounds can be changed before a game starts. 

\section{IITO}
During IITO, opinions between islands can change. For every gift received, team 1 agent's opinion of the gifter increases. However, an islands opinion can decrease if that island promised a gift and was not able to fulfill it. 

When team 1 agent's receives a request for gifts, it will decide how much to offer depending on the personality and its opinion of that island. If the agent is desperate, then it will refuse all gift requests therefore offering a gift of 0. If the agent is anxious, then gift offers will be a proportion of the current resources that it is happy to give away. If the agent is happy, then it will freely offer resources that satisfy the incoming gift request amount.

However, at times if an opinion of an island is very high, the agent can decide to give gifts disregarding it's own anxiety. On the other hand, if an opinion of an island is very low, the agent can decide to refuse to send a gift even though the agent is happy. 

Naturally, team 1's agent will accept all gift offers that comes its way.
