\chapter{Inter Island Forecasting Organisation (IIFO)}

The role of IIFO is to allow islands to make predictions about the likelihood and severity of risks in the event of natural disasters, which correlates to the long term collective risk dilemma, and the returns from foraging, which correlates to the short term collective risk dilemma.

\section{Long Term Collective Risk Dilemma (ltCRD)}
\label{sec:IIFO:ltCRD}

% Natural Disaster Forecasting
%   - Islands can share predictions on when and where a disaster and how severe it will be along with their confidence in their prediction
%   - Accurate predictions mean the damage can be minimised by islands pooling their resources to meet the necessary level to be protected
%   - Inaccurate predictions may mean islands are taken by surprise or pool their resources unnecessarily

Islands may build a model to try and predict the likelihood and severity of upcoming disasters. They are then able to share this with the other islands along with a confidence level in their prediction. The motivation behind sharing this information is that the more people contributing to the common pool, the more the effects of the disaster can be mitigated. Sharing predictions allows the islands to better manage their resources as they have a better idea of when they should be donated to the common pool or not.

Inaccurate predictions may mean that the islands are not prepared for a coming disaster, as it was predicted to come much later, meaning the common pool may not yet be large enough to mitigate the disaster effectively. Alternatively, the islands may over prepare and donate too much to the common pool when a disaster is not imminent, meaning they have unnecessarily reduced their own resources making it harder to forage and build up resources again.

\section{Short Term Collective Risk Dilemma (stCRD)}
\label{sec:IIFO:stCRD}

% Foraging Returns Forecasting
%   - Islands can share predictions on how much returns they expect from foraging at different locations
%   - Accurate predictions allow islands to maximise returns by foraging in the right place
%   - Inaccurate predictions may mean islands lose out on potential gains
