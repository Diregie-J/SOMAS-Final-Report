\chapter{Inter Island Forecasting Organisation (IIFO)}

The role of IIFO is to allow islands to make predictions about the likelihood and severity of risks in the event of natural disasters, which correlates to the long term collective risk dilemma, and the returns from foraging, which correlates to the short term collective risk dilemma.

\section{Long Term Collective Risk Dilemma (ltCRD)}
\label{sec:IIFO:ltCRD}

% Natural Disaster Forecasting
%   - Islands can share predictions on when and where a disaster and how severe it will be along with their confidence in their prediction
%   - Accurate predictions mean the damage can be minimised by islands pooling their resources to meet the necessary level to be protected
%   - Inaccurate predictions may mean islands are taken by surprise or pool their resources unnecessarily
