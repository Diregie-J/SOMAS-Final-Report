\chapter{Inter Island Forecasting Organisation (IIFO)}

The role of IIFO is to allow islands to make predictions about the likelihood and severity of risks in the event of natural disasters, which correlates to the long term collective risk dilemma, and the returns from foraging, which correlates to the short term collective risk dilemma.
